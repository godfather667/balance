# balance
A Complete Example of a Load Balancing Program.

The documentation for this program is in "GOConcurrencyLoadBalancing.pdf" in the repository and
available online at *hawthornepresscom@gmail.com*.

Since this is intended to introduce new developers the load balancing concepts the code itself
is heavily annotated.
